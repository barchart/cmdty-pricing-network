## How Can I Access It?

Users can generally access the content through either software or an enterprise data solution.  

**Software Consumption** - Individual users can subscribe to the data for use in our trading and analytics software.  Single users can register directly through us and pricing is standard for most CPN contributor datasets.  For teams and large groups of users, bulk pricing may be available.
* [cmdtyView Pro](https://www.barchart.com/cmdty/trading/cmdtyview) - This is our flagship software product for commodity trading and analytics.  Access any data you subscribe to from the CPN alongside all of our other content.
* [cmdtyView Excel](https://www.barchart.com/cmdty/trading/cmdtyview-excel) - Our Excel Add-in that is included with your cmdtyView Pro subscription, but can be subscribed to as a standalone service.  With the flexibility of Excel, and all of the same data you get in cmdtyView, the possibilities for what you can build are endless.

**Enterprise Data Solution**  - Many firms want to be able to use data from our contributors throughout their organization and within various risk systems, data reporting tools, or other 3rd-party software.  We can deliver data via API, SFTP, or other data transfer services subject to client requirements.  Pricing will generally depend on how the data is used throughout the organization, who can access it, and the breadth of coverage.  For some providers we have set pricing and for others we will work with the client and the provider to establish a use case and find a package that meets everyone's goals.

In summary, you simply pay Barchart for use of our software and/or any technology fees associated with delivering of the data.  Any fees associated with the content of our CPN contributors are set by them.  By subscribing through us, you get to use the data in our purpose-built software products, and can use it alongside any other content that you get from Barchart - we basically simplify everything from user access through to billing.

## Product Roadmap?
We are always looking at onboarding datasets and providers that align with our clients.
